class Move(object):
    """Parent class for proposals or "moves"

    Args:
        temperature_control (:class:`tempering.TemperatureControl`, optional):
            This object controls the tempering. It is passed to the parent class
            to moves so that all proposals can share and use temperature settings.
            (default: ``None``)
        periodic (:class:`eryn.utils.PeriodicContainer, optional):
            This object holds periodic information and methods for periodic parameters. It is passed to the parent class
            to moves so that all proposals can share and use periodic information.
            (default: ``None``)
        gibbs_sampling_setup (str, tuple, dict, or list, optional): This sets the Gibbs Sampling setup if
            desired. The Gibbs sampling setup is completely customizable down to the leaf and parameters.
            All of the separate Gibbs sampling splits will be run within 1 call to this proposal.
            If ``None``, run all branches and all parameters. If ``str``, run all parameters within the
            branch given as the string. To enter a branch with a specific set of parameters, you can
            provide a 2-tuple with the first entry as the branch name and the second entry as a 2D
            boolean array of shape ``(nleaves_max, ndim)`` that indicates which leaves and/or parameters
            you want to run. ``None`` can also be entered in the second entry if all parameters are to be run.
            A dictionary is also possible with keys as branch names and values as the same 2D boolean array
            of shape ``(nleaves_max, ndim)`` that indicates which leaves and/or parameters
            you want to run. ``None`` can also be entered in the value of the dictionary
            if all parameters are to be run. If multiple keys are provided in the dictionary, those
            branches will be run simultaneously in the proposal as one iteration of the proposing loop.
            The final option is a list. This is how you make sure to run all the Gibbs splits. Each entry
            of the list can be a string, 2-tuple, or dictionary as described above. The list controls
            the order in which all of these splits are run. (default: ``None``)
        prevent_swaps (bool, optional): If ``True``, do not perform temperature swaps in this move.
        skip_supp_names_update (list, optional): List of names (`str`), that can be in any
            :class:`eryn.state.BranchSupplemental`,
            to skip when updating states (:func:`Move.update`). This is useful if a
            large amount of memory is stored in the branch supplementals.
        is_rj (bool, optional): If using RJ, this should be ``True``. (default: ``False``)
        use_gpu (bool, optional): If ``True``, use ``CuPy`` for computations.
            Use ``NumPy`` if ``use_gpu == False``. (default: ``False``)
        random_seed (int, optional): Set the random seed in ``CuPy/NumPy`` if not ``None``.
            (default: ``None``)

    Raises:
        ValueError: Incorrect inputs.

    Attributes:
        Note: All kwargs are stored as attributes.
        num_proposals (int): the number of times this move has been run. This is needed to
            compute the acceptance fraction.
        gibbs_sampling_setup (list): All of the Gibbs sampling splits as described above.
        xp (obj): ``NumPy`` or ``CuPy``.
        use_gpu (bool): Whether ``Cupy`` (``True``) is used or not (``False``).
